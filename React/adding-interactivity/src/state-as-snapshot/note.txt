State As A Snapshot
-------------------
- State behaves more like a snapshot

Setting State Triggers Renders (N1)
-----------------------------------
1. The onSubmit event handler executes.
2. setIsSent(true) sets isSent to true and queues a new render.
3. React re-renders the component according to the new isSent value.

Rendering takes a snapshot in time (N2)
----------------------------------------
When React re-renders a component
1. React calls your function again
2. You component returns a new JSX snapshot
3. React then updates the screen to update the snapshot your function returned

Your component returns a snapshot of UI with a fresh set of props and event handlers in its JSX, 
all calculated using the state values from that render.
