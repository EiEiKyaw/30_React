Render And Commit
-----------------
Imagine that your components are cooks in the kitchen, assembling tasty dishes from ingredients. 
In this scenario, React is the waiter who puts in requests from customers and brings them their orders. 
This process of requesting and serving UI has three steps:

1. Triggering a render (delivering the guestâ€™s order to the kitchen)
2. Rendering the component (preparing the order in the kitchen)
3. Committing to the DOM (placing the order on the table)

Step 1: Trigger a render
------------------------
There are two reasons for a component to render:
1.1. It's the component's initial render
1.2. The commponent's state has been updated

Step 2: React renders your components
-------------------------------------
2.1. On initial render, React will call the root component.
2.2. For subsequent renders, React will call the function component whose update triggered the render

Step 3: React commits changes to the DOM
-----------------------------------------
3.1. For the initial render, React will use the appendChild() DOM API to put all the DOM nodes it has created on screen
3.2. For re-renders, React will apply the minimal necessary operations to make the DOM match the latest rendering output.
... React only changes the DOM nodes if there's difference between renders
