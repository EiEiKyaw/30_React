Component needs to remember things: the current input value, image, shopping items, .....
In React, this kind of component specific memory is called 'State'

useState
--------
1. A state variable to retain the data between renders
2. A state setter function to update the variable and trigger React to render the component again

Hook
-----
1. useState, as well as any other function starting with 'use', is called a Hook 
2. can only be called at the top level of your components or own Hooks
3. Hooks are special functions that are only available while React is rendering

const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
index is a state variable
setIndex is the setter function

State is isolated and private (N3_IsolatedAndPrivateInState.js)
-----------------------------
1. If you render the same component twice, each copy will have completely isolated state!
2. State is not tied to a particular function call or a place in the code
3. Unlike props, state is fully private to the component declaring it
