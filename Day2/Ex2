===>>> Why did you chose to use react?

- Component-Based Architecture: React promotes building UIs using reusable components, which can be independently developed, tested, and maintained. This leads to more modular and manageable code.
- Virtual DOM: React's virtual DOM efficiently updates and renders components, providing better performance especially in applications with frequent updates.
- Strong Community and Ecosystem: React has a large, active community and a rich ecosystem of libraries, tools, and extensions. This makes finding solutions, getting support, and integrating third-party tools easier.
- Flexibility: React is often referred to as the "V" (View) in MVC, allowing developers to use it with other libraries or frameworks for the rest of their application stack.
- Performance: The virtual DOM, as well as optimizations for re-rendering, make React applications typically fast and efficient.
- Backed by Facebook: React is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. This backing provides confidence in the ongoing support and evolution of the library.
- Learning Curve: While it introduces concepts like JSX and component-based architecture, many developers find React easier to learn compared to some other frameworks due to its simplicity and focus.

===>>> What measures do you use to know popularity ?

To gauge the popularity of a technology like React, several metrics and sources can be considered:

- GitHub Stars and Contributions: The number of stars, forks, and contributions on the project's GitHub repository.
- NPM Downloads: The number of weekly downloads on the npm (Node Package Manager) registry provides insight into how many developers are using it.
- Google Trends: Search interest over time as tracked by Google Trends.
- Job Market Demand: The number of job postings requiring React skills on job boards like Indeed, LinkedIn, etc.
- Surveys: Developer surveys, such as the Stack Overflow Developer Survey, which often ask about preferred tools and technologies.
- Social Media and Community Activity: Discussions and mentions on platforms like Twitter, Reddit, Stack Overflow, and specialized forums.

===>>> What is more popular, React or Vue ?

React and Vue are both popular JavaScript frameworks/libraries, each with its own strengths and community. As of my knowledge cutoff in 2024:

- GitHub Stars: Vue generally has more GitHub stars compared to React, indicating high interest and satisfaction among developers.
- React: ~212k stars
- Vue: ~210k stars
- NPM Downloads: React typically has a higher number of weekly downloads on npm, suggesting broader usage in the industry.
  React: ~11 million weekly downloads
  Vue: ~3 million weekly downloads
- Job Market: React tends to have a higher demand in the job market, with more job postings requiring React skills compared to Vue.
- Google Trends: React usually has higher search interest globally compared to Vue.
