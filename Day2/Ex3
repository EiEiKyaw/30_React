===>>> What is JSX?
JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX looks similar to HTML but allows you to write HTML structures within JavaScript code.

const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;

---------------- xxxxxxxxxx ----------------

===>>> What is Babel?
Babel is a JavaScript compiler that allows you to use next-generation JavaScript features today. It converts (or transpiles) modern JavaScript code into a version that is compatible with older browsers. Babel can also convert JSX syntax into regular JavaScript that browsers can understand.

===>>> What is a Transpiler?
A transpiler (short for "source-to-source compiler") is a type of compiler that translates code from one programming language to another at the same level of abstraction. In the context of web development, Babel is a transpiler that converts modern JavaScript (ES6+ and JSX) into ES5 JavaScript, which can run in older browsers that do not support newer JavaScript features. Another example is TypeScript transpiling to JavaScript.

Here is a simple example of how Babel works:

Input (modern JavaScript or JSX):
const greet = () => {
return <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
};

Output (transpiled JavaScript):
var greet = function greet() {
return React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello, world!");
};
